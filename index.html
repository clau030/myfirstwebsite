    <h3>Morning/Afternoon</h3>
        <p>After a waking up in the morning to eat hay and drink water, Lola takes a long snooze <br> under the coffee table. But that doesn't mean she's lazy. Multiple times a day Lola does <br> a cardio workout of running up and down the stairs to stay in shape.</p>

    <h3>Evening/Night</h3>
        <p>Tired from all that running, Lola takes her afternoon siesta, until it's time for dinner.<br> She eats her leafy greens in the evening and prepares for a night of digging up the <br> carpet and chewing on the wooden furniture. All in all, she's had a perfect day.</p>
